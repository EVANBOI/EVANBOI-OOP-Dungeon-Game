[Links to your merge requests](/put/links/here)

> i. Look inside src/main/java/dungeonmania/entities/enemies. Where can you notice an instance of repeated code? Note down the particular offending lines/methods/fields.

[Answer]

> ii. What Design Pattern could be used to improve the quality of the code and avoid repetition? Justify your choice by relating the scenario to the key characteristics of your chosen Design Pattern.

[Answer]

> iii. Using your chosen Design Pattern, refactor the code to remove the repetition.

[Briefly explain what you did]

### b) Pattern Analysis

[Links to your merge requests](/put/links/here)

> i. Identify one place where the State Pattern is present in the codebase. Do you think this is an appropriate use of the State Pattern?

[Answer]

> ii. (Option 1) If you answered that it was an appropriate use of the State Pattern, justify how the implementation relates to the key characteristics of the State Pattern.

> (Option 2) If you answered that it was not an appropriate use of the State Pattern, refactor the code to improve the implementation. You may choose to improve the usage of the pattern, switch to a different design pattern, or remove the pattern entirely.

[Answer or brief explanation of your code]

### c) Inheritance Design

[Links to your merge requests](/put/links/here)

> i. List one design principle that is violated by collectable objects based on the description above. Briefly justify your answer.

[Answer]

> ii. Refactor the inheritance structure of the code, and in the process remove the design principle violation you identified.

[Briefly explain what you did]

### d) More Code Smells

[Links to your merge requests](/put/links/here)

> i. What code smell is present in the above snippet?

[Answer]

> ii. Refactor the code to resolve the smell and underlying problem causing it.

[Briefly explain what you did]

### e) Open-Closed Goals

[Links to your merge requests](/put/links/here)

> i. Do you think the design is of good quality here? Do you think it complies with the open-closed principle? Do you think the design should be changed?

[Answer]

> ii. If you think the design is sufficient as it is, justify your decision. If you think the answer is no, pick a suitable Design Pattern that would improve the quality of the code and refactor the code accordingly.
