# OOP Dungeon Game  

## Introduction 
**Dungeonmania** is a **Java-based dungeon crawler game**, originally developed by previous students as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for **Penguin Pty Ltd**. Our goal is to **refactor, improve, and extend** the existing codebase, incorporating **design patterns and new features** while maintaining code quality and scalability.  

This document provides an overview of the project, including **objectives, key features, challenges, and reflections**.

## Project Overview  

### Aim  
This assignment aims to simulate a **real-world software engineering scenario** where developers inherit an existing codebase and must **analyse, refactor, and extend** it. Key goals include:  

1. **Understanding and improving an existing codebase**  
2. **Refactoring code using design principles and patterns**  
3. **Adapting the system to evolving requirements**  
4. **Collaborating efficiently using Git and CI/CD pipelines**  
5. **Testing and ensuring software quality through structured validation**  

### Objectives and Skills Demonstrated  
✅ **Codebase Familiarization**: Navigating and understanding an unfamiliar **large-scale codebase**.  
✅ **Refactoring & Clean Code**: Identifying and resolving **design smells** using **SOLID principles**.  
✅ **Design Patterns**: Implementing and recognizing **object-oriented design patterns**.  
✅ **Requirement Evolution**: Extending the game’s functionality to accommodate new features.  
✅ **Software Engineering Practices**: Following **version control, CI/CD, and best development practices**.

## Development Stages  

### **Phase 1: Code Analysis & Refactoring**  
- Identifying **code smells** and refactoring using **design patterns**.  
- Applying **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**, **Open-Closed Principle**, and **inheritance improvements**.  
- Ensuring the codebase is **scalable and maintainable**.  

### **Phase 2: Evolution of Requirements**  
- Implementing **new game mechanics** such as **enemy goals, bosses, and logic switches**.  
- Enhancing the **dungeon environment** with **swamp tiles, buildables, and interactive entities**.  
- Iterative development and testing to ensure **functionality and stability**.  

### **Phase 3: Investigation Task**  
- Conducting a **deep dive into technical challenges** within the project.  
- Exploring **advanced programming concepts** related to **game development and logic systems**.

### **Entity Management**  
- **Collectables**: Players can **collect and use items** such as **keys, potions, and treasures**.  
- **Buildables**: Craftable items, including **shields and enchanted weapons**.  

### **Dynamic Dungeon Mechanics**  
- **Complex Goals System**: Players must **complete multiple objectives** to win.  
- **Logic Switches & Traps**: Advanced dungeon mechanics for **interactive gameplay**.  
- **AI-driven Enemy Movement**: Enemies have **unique movement behaviors** and **combat strategies**.  

### **Refactored & Scalable Codebase**  
- Implementation of **design patterns** for **cleaner, more maintainable code**.  
- **Improved OOP structure** to allow for **easier future expansions**.

## Reflections  

### **Challenges and Solutions**  

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Navigating a large, unfamiliar codebase | Conducted **code walkthroughs** and **UML analysis** to understand system design. |
| Identifying and fixing design flaws | Used **code smells analysis** and applied **SOLID principles** for refactoring. |
| Implementing new game mechanics without breaking existing code | Followed **iterative development** and wrote **unit tests** to validate changes. |
| Working with limited documentation | Explored **test cases** and **existing code behaviors** to infer system requirements. |

### **Soft Skills Demonstrated**  
- **Collaboration**: Effectively **pair programming** and resolving design disagreements.  
- **Problem-Solving**: Overcoming challenges in **legacy code modification**.  
- **Time Management**: Balancing multiple **tasks and iterations** efficiently.  

### **Learning**  
✅ **Advanced Object-Oriented Design**: Gained deeper understanding of **inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**.  
✅ **Software Design Patterns**: Applied **Factory, Strategy, Observer, and Singleton patterns**.  
✅ **Testing & Debugging**: Strengthened skills in **unit testing, integration testing, and debugging**.
